# to-do-list

## Purpose
I created this to do list because I wanted a simple way to keep track of all of the tasks that I need to complete that is accessible from anywhere. 

## Documentation
Each of the items on the to do list are stored in the activities array. This is called upon to dynamically update the To Do List each time an activity is added or removed. This data is stored in the local storage of the browser and is recalled whenever the page is reopened.
